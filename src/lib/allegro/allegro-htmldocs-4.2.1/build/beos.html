<p>
   Status: It compiles for Intel R4 &amp; R5. Port is complete.



<p><br>
<h1><a name="Required software">Required software</a></h1>

<p>
   BeOS Intel R4 and R5 Pro Edition come with everything you need. If you
   have BeOS Intel R5 Personal Edition, you require the development tools;
   these can be found on the Be homepage at <a href="http://www.be.com">http://www.be.com</a>. You also need
   updated binutils, which can be found at <a href="http://bebits.com">http://bebits.com</a>. It might not
   be a bad idea to update gcc as well, but is not required.

<h1><a name="Installing Allegro">Installing Allegro</a></h1>

<p>
   Allegro comes as a source distribuition: you'll have to compile it to get
   it to work. Unzip the library archive wherever you want, and cd into that
   directory with a Terminal. Due to the multi-platform nature of Allegro,
   you need to run:
<blockquote class="text"><pre>
      fix.sh beos
</pre></blockquote>
   This will set the library ready to be compiled on the Be platform.
   Now you must build it:
<blockquote class="text"><pre>
      make
</pre></blockquote>
   And then install it:
<blockquote class="text"><pre>
      make install
</pre></blockquote>
   With this last command the Allegro library will be installed into
   <tt>/boot/home/config/lib</tt> (the default location for BeOS shared libraries),
   while the headers will go into <tt>/boot/develop/headers</tt> (the default
   locations where Be looks for them).
   
<p>
   You have now installed Allegro! See the rest of the documentation and
   examples to learn more about it. A simple example of a command line to
   compile an allegro program:
<blockquote class="text"><pre>
      gcc foo.c -O2 -Wall -o foo `allegro-config --shared`
</pre></blockquote>   
   The `<tt>allegro-config --shared</tt>` is explained in the next section.
        
<p>
   The dynamically linked version of Allegro gets built by default but if
   you want to build the statically linked version of Allegro write the
   following on the command line:
<blockquote class="text"><pre>
      export STATICLINK=1
</pre></blockquote>
   In the same manner we can also enter one of the following lines to
   build either the debug or the profiling version of the library:
<blockquote class="text"><pre>
      export DEBUGMODE=1
      export PROFILEMODE=1
</pre></blockquote>
   Then we can start to actually make and install the Allegro library.
<blockquote class="text"><pre>
      make
      make install
</pre></blockquote>
   If you have compiled a static version of the library, it will be copied to
   <tt>/boot/develop/lib/x86</tt>.
     


<p><br>
<h1><a name="Using Allegro">Using Allegro</a></h1>
   
<p>
   Linking Allegro to a program also requires you to link several other BeOS
   libraries and set the correct library search pathes. To simplify the
   linking process, the installation sets up a script, <tt>allegro-config</tt>, that
   will print out a suitable commandline. You can use this inside backtick
   command substitution, for example:
<blockquote class="text"><pre>
      gcc myfile.c -o myprogram `allegro-config --static`
</pre></blockquote>
   This will enable you to link against the static library.
   
<p>
   The `<tt>allegro-config --shared</tt>` option mentioned above will output all the
   options and libraries needed to link dynamically against the shared
   version of the Allegro library. If you use <tt>--libs</tt> instead of <tt>--shared</tt> or
   <tt>--static</tt>, the script will generate the linking arguments according to the
   latest installed library version. You can also run these <tt>allegro-config</tt>
   commands on the commandline to see what exactly they do.

<p>
   If you want to build a debug version of your program, assuming that 
   you have installed the debug version of Allegro, use:
<blockquote class="text"><pre>
      gcc myfile.c -o myprogram `allegro-config --libs debug`
</pre></blockquote>
   Terminal newbies, take note that these are ` backticks, not normal '
   quotes!

<p>
   There are also other switches for printing out the Allegro version number,
   or to override the install paths. Run <tt>allegro-config</tt> without any
   arguments for a full list of options.

<p>
   Don't forget that you need to use the <code>END_OF_MAIN()</code> macro right after
   your <code>main()</code> function!
