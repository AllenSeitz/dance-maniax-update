          Borland C++Builder-specific information.

<p>
   Status: it works.  It currently doesn't build the Allegro library
   from the sources, but it does let you compile your own Allegro-based
   programs and run them with the Allegro DLLs.  Thanks to Inprise for
   creating the very useful IMPLIB program. 

<p>
   The screensaver example is built, but you must copy <tt>scrsave.scr</tt> to
   your <tt>windows/system</tt> directory (or <tt>winnt/system32</tt> directory
   under Windows NT/2k/XP) if you want to test it.



<p><br>
<h1><a name="Required software">Required software</a></h1>

<p>
   <ul><li>Borland C++Builder (or Borland C++ command line tools)
   <li>Recent set of DirectX and other Windows SDK headers.
   <li>GNU make 3.77 or higher.
   <li>Optional: GNU sed. Used by "<tt>make depend</tt>" and "<tt>fixdll.bat</tt>".
   <li>Optional: GNU sort (not DOS sort). Used by "<tt>fixdll.bat</tt>".
</ul>
   In order to run your programs, you need to obtain the Allegro DLLs and
   install them in the Windows system directory.

<p>
   This is known to work with the Borland C++ 5.5 command line compiler.
   Earlier versions may cause problems (for example v5.02).

<p>
   You need to use GNU make, since Borland make is really ugly about its
   makefiles. You can grab it from either the MinGW or DJGPP
   distributions; more info on this in available in the following files:
   <tt><a href="mingw32.html">docs/build/mingw32.txt</a></tt> and <tt><a href="djgpp.html">docs/build/djgpp.txt</a></tt>.



<p><br>
<h1><a name="Installing Allegro">Installing Allegro</a></h1>

<p>
   Set up your environment so that Borland C++ can be used from the
   commandline. Then set the variable BCC32DIR to the directory where
   Borland C++ is located, for example '<tt>set BCC32DIR=c:\bcc32</tt>'.

<p>
   Type "<tt>cd allegro</tt>" and then "<tt>fix.bat bcc32</tt>".  Then, run "<tt>make</tt>".  Find
   something fun to do while it's compiling.  It will eventually
   finish; then just type "<tt>make install</tt>" to set the library up for use.

<p>
   If you also want to install a debugging version of the library (highly 
   recommended), type "<tt>make install DEBUGMODE=1</tt>".  Case is important, so 
   it must be <tt>DEBUGMODE</tt>, not <tt>debugmode</tt>!

<p>
   If you also want to install a profiling version of the library, now type 
   "<tt>make install PROFILEMODE=1</tt>".

<p>
   If your copy of Allegro doesn't include the makefile.dep dependency files 
   (unlikely, unless you have run "<tt>make veryclean</tt>" at some point), you can 
   regenerate them by running "<tt>make depend</tt>".

<p>
   If your copy of Allegro doesn't include the linker .def file (unlikely, 
   unless you have run "<tt>make veryclean</tt>" at some point), you can regenerate 
   it by running "<tt>misc\fixdll.bat</tt>".



<p><br>
<h1><a name="Using Allegro">Using Allegro</a></h1>

<p>
   All the Allegro functions, variables, and data structures are defined in 
   <tt>allegro.h</tt>. You should include this in your programs, and link with one of
   the libraries:
<blockquote class="text"><pre>
      alleg.lib      - optimised DLL import library
      alld.lib       - debugging DLL import library
      allp.lib       - profiling DLL import library
</pre></blockquote>
   Don't forget that you need to use the <code>END_OF_MAIN()</code> macro right after
   your <code>main()</code> function!

<p>
   You will need to distribute the appropriate DLL along with your program.
