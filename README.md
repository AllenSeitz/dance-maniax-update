# dance-maniax-update
This repo is for my fan-made recreation of Konami's 1999 arcade game, Dance Maniax.

Unlike other fan game projects which are usually clones or simulators, my goal
was to make a modern Windows port. My software is designed to replace the
original software (and hardware, which may be failing) in a Dance Maniax or
Dance Freaks arcade machine.

The source code in this repo is copyrighted by me and MAY NOT be used to create
further derivative works. (Use Stepmania if that is what you want. This project
is not based on Stepmania, nor is it related to it.)

Permission is granted to run the software and play the game however you like
without restriction.

The installation instructions have been UPDATED as of September 7th, 2022.

To install the game download the file "install.ps1" above and run it. This is a
Windows PowerShell script that will download 7 zip files (about 775 MB total),
extract them (about 2 GB total), and then delete the zip files.

To run the game simply run DMX.exe after a successful install. The first run of
the program will prompt you to change the default settings.
