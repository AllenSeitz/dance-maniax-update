# dance-maniax-update
Formerly located at code.google.com/p/dance-maniax-update

This repo is for my fan-made recreation of Konami's 1999 arcade game, Dance Maniax.

Unlike other fan game projects which are usually clones or simulators, my goal
was to make merely a modern Windows port. My software is designed to replace the
original software (and hardware, which may be failing) in a Dance Maniax or
Dance Freaks machine.

The source code in this repo is copyrighted by me and MAY NOT be used to create
further derivative works. (Use Stepmania if that is what you want.) You may of
course run the game however you'd like.
