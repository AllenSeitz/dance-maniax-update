# dance-maniax-update
This repo is for my fan-made recreation of Konami's 1999 arcade game, Dance Maniax.

Unlike other fan game projects which are usually clones or simulators, my goal
was to make a modern Windows port. My software is designed to replace the
original software (and hardware, which may be failing) in a Dance Maniax or
Dance Freaks arcade machine.

The source code in this repo is copyrighted by me and MAY NOT be used to create
further derivative works. (Use Stepmania if that is what you want. This project
is not based on Stepmania, nor is it related to it.)

Permission is granted to run the software and play the game however you like
without restriction.

To run the game download the file "install.zip" above, extract it, and run the
program DMX.exe inside. The program will open and close itself several times as it
downloads data and patches itself. This large download (about 2 GB) only happens
during the first install.
