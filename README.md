# THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER BEING UPDATED
For many years I was updating the source code here with new features, compatibility
for new and different io boards, and bugfixes. Mostly bugfixes.

But now the engine is starting to show its age and it needs a lot of work to remain
useful. I've been putting off updates to the window resolution, the song selection,
the background videos, nonstop mode, and more. And honestly Stepmania just does a
better job now. I don't have much motivation to continue to update my code when
Stepmania is just simply a better engine and a better choice.

In the future I may start a new project, such as a curated Stepmania theme plus
songpack which would be designed for modern rhythm game fans. Such a project likely
would not be allowed on GitHub. In the meantime besides Stepmania I also recommend
running the original game in MAME!

# dance-maniax-update
This repo is for my fan-made recreation of Konami's 1999 arcade game, Dance Maniax.

Unlike other fan game projects which are usually clones or simulators, my goal
was to make a modern Windows port. My software is designed to replace the
original software (and hardware, which may be failing) in a Dance Maniax or
Dance Freaks arcade machine.

The source code in this repo is copyrighted by me and MAY NOT be used to create
further derivative works. (Use Stepmania if that is what you want. This project
is not based on Stepmania, nor is it related to it.)

Permission is granted to run the software and play the game however you like
without restriction.

The installation instructions have been UPDATED as of September 7th, 2022.
Installing the game is now easier than ever!

To install the game download the file "install.ps1" above and run it. This is a
Windows PowerShell script that will download 7 zip files (about 775 MB total),
extract them (about 2 GB total), and then delete the zip files. To run a
Powershell file, first open a Powershell prompt, then type ".\install.ps1"

To run the game simply run DMX.exe after a successful install. The first run of
the program will prompt you to change the default settings.
It will also download even more songs!
